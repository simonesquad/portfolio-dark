Update 2022: Will be integrating Chakra-UI design features for better UI experience.

Why did I choose Chakra-UI for a preferred design library this year? Well for one thing the responsiveness is amazing, and I'm loving all of the options with their built-in hooks. I find the components intuitive and it is highly customizeable, plus the look is actually modern and functional. While I still like to write a lot of my own CSS, this has facilitated make the foundational design stronger so that I have more time to focus on the fun design parts. This is one of the first react apps I ever created so it is close to my heart, but I am moving onto other topics now in programming in general so I wanted a rework that would be reflective of both my current level but also my shift in priorities. Either way, I hope some personality is still showing through!

I like simplicity in design in case you could not tell... also this includes my legacy CV and some copywriting by myself. 

Thanks and get in touch if you'd like to work together ;)
